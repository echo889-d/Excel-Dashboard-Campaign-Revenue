### Introduction to the Dashboard

The "Campaign Revenue Dashboard" demonstrates my proficiency in Excel, especially in analyzing and identifying revenue growth opportunities. The dashboard integrates multiple data views and analyses, providing a holistic understanding of revenue performance and potential areas for growth. 

Key capabilities showcased in this file include:

- **Trend Analysis**: The "Over Time" sheet visualizes revenue trends, helping to identify patterns and significant changes over different periods.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Sheets like "Company," "Genre," and "Promotion" break down revenue data by various dimensions, enabling a deeper understanding of what drives revenue.
- **Growth Opportunities Identification**: The "Net Growth Opportunity" sheet provides a focused analysis on areas with the potential for increased revenue, guiding strategic decision-making.
